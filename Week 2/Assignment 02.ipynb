    "Big data is a rapidly evolving, ever-changing field. Keeping track of the latest big data stacks, programming libraries, software, and other tools requires constant vigilance. Any book on big data will be out of date by the time it is published. We need a resource that is updated on a more frequent basis. \n",

    "*[Awesome Jupyter](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter)* is a curated list of awesome Jupyter projects, libraries and resources. Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Awesome Dash](https://github.com/ucg8j/awesome-dash)* is a curated list of awesome Dash (plotly) resources. Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications. Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.\n",
